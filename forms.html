    <!--
        the form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form must be put inside.
        the attributes that are requied are name, id, and method.

        name gives some descriptive infomation about what the form will be used for.

        id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.

        method has two typical values: get and post.
         get is used for forms that do not ask for personal infomatoiin (search bars, ect).
        post is used for forms that ask for personal infomation (login and signup pages, etc)
    -->
    <form name="travel-suggestions" id="travel" method="get">
        
        <!--
            this is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all reuired attributes.
            the required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure that user
             has fill in the input before submitting the form.

            the type attribute defines the type of input.
            the name attribute defnies the variable name that would be used for the input when the data gets passed to the server 
            (requires back-end scripting, which is beyomd the scope of this cource)
            the id attribute allowsus to reference the input from the label and from other parts of out code.

            all inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the input using the inputs id attribute.
            when an input is required, it is important to include the word required in the labels text
        -->

        <!--
            a fieldset is an area in your form where you put inputs that are more related to each other
            than they are related to other inputs in the form (i.e. a list of travel items is more 
            related to each other then the country the person is recommeneding)
